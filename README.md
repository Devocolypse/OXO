# OXO
Play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in the Ruby command line!

## How Do I Play?
Simply clone or download the repository, navigate to the root `OXO` folder in
your command line, install the required gems, and run `ruby main.rb`. This repo
assumes you know how Tic-Tac-Toe works!

## What I Learned

Oh boy, what _didn't_ I learn? This was probably the most difficult of
[TOP][1]'s Ruby projects thus far, but seeing it _actually_ work was awesome:

- How Ruby classes work together
- How to leverage private methods while not exposing too much of the interface
- the concepts behind OOP (once you get the hang of it with Ruby, it kinda
just clicks)
- how to write a (simple) game loop, or any loop that prompts the user
until some condition is met for that matter
- Loops and iteration, yet again!
- Not to give up, keep it simple, take breaks, use pen and paper

## Possible Updates (?)

- Add color to make it easier to distinguish between Players and Board
- GUI
